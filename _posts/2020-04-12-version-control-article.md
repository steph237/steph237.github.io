<h2>WHAT IS VERSION CONTROL</h2>
As a developer, you have most likely come in contact with Verion sofwarers like Git and I am guessing you were as confused as I was when i heard it. Basically, these systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can go back to earlier versions of the code and compare them to find the errrors.

<h2> HOW USEFUL IS VERSION CONTROL TO NOVICE AND PROFESSIONALS</h2>
Working with a version control system is as important to a novice as it is to a professional. Lets see the key points that make it so important

  <li><h3>No data loss</h3>Nothing that is committed to version control is ever lost, unless you work really, really hard at it. Since all old versions of files are saved, itâ€™s always possible to go back in time to see exactly who wrote what on a particular day, or what version of a program was used to generate a particular set of results.</li>
